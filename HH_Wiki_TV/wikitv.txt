1. Go into recipes.xml enable which mod you plan to add an image to if you want players to be able to craft them.

   If not then you can just cm them into the game or lobby.





2. want to edit wiki tv title texts? go to windows.xml

   I have labled every wiki tv so it's easy go to text="TEXT HERE" for the tv you want and just edit that text here part nothing else.

   leave the quatations etc the same only edit the text!





3. Make an image you want placed into the tv via adobe etc w.e save it as a small file the smaller the better.
   IMAGE SIZE width="1048" height="628" 


4. go to windows.xml again find the tv you want and edit the  URL. Find a place to host your image free there is lots google it. 



5. Save and done!
